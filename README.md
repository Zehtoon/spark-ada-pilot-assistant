# spark-ada-pilot-assistant
🛩️ Pilot Assistant — SPARK Ada

Overview
A lightweight pilot-assistant system written in SPARK Ada, designed as a safety-focused control logic demonstrator. The project explores reliable software design in safety-critical systems such as aviation control.

🎯 Objectives

- Implement a deterministic control loop for stability assistance.

- Demonstrate formal verification using SPARK Ada’s proof system.

- Showcase the importance of reliability and precision in embedded systems.

🧩 Features

- Basic flight state monitoring (altitude, speed, pitch).

- Automated correction for unsafe conditions.

- Proof annotations for safety properties (SPARK contracts).

⚙️ Tech Stack

- Language: SPARK Ada

- Tools: GNATprove, GPS/VSCode with Ada extension

- Paradigm: Deterministic, formally verified design

📘 Future Work

- Integrate sensor simulation inputs.

- Expand to multi-axis control models.

- Connect to real-time systems interface.
